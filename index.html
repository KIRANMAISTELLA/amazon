      Mother Teresa founded the Order of the Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic congregation of women dedicated to the poor, particularly to those in India, that opened numerous centres serving the blind, the aged, and the disabled.<BR>When she was only 9 years old, her father Nikola Bojaxhiu had died. After Nicola's death, his business partners ran away with all the money.<BR> At that time the world war was also going on, due to all these reasons his family was also going through financial problems. That was the most tragic period for her and her family.<BR>But her mother, Dranafile Bojaxhiu, was a very strong woman. She never lost hope. And take all the responsibilities to feed her family, she took on her shoulder. She started from a small business for the survival of her family where she sold embroidered clothes and other crafted clothes. If later on, all these qualities come in them too.<BR></p>

        <h3>Why did Mother Teresa wear blue and white?</h3>
        <p>The reason why the Saint chose white saree with three blue stripes and not a different dress was because that is what she had been beseeched to adopt by Jesus Christ as the dress of her Order. <br>The vision had come to her during her train journey to Darjeeling.</p>
